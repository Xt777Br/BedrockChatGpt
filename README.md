## Resources and Others

I dont have a paid version of ChatGpt so in release you may have problems using paid version. So report with a screenshot!

This program can take some information about world! For now he just can take 3 information: Day, Day, Weather. I have plans to improve in future version using addons to better informations and speed!

This program is fully Python but it will not be open source, because i want make better version more optimized and organized. Maybe you can get the codes aceesing with other ways but its is ok. Just dont steal the codes!

How everyone know Chatgpt dont have a updated informations so he can not know newest minecraft things!

ChatGpt is really dumb in minecraft but it is being better with the time. How you can see in the question about glass panes.
